      There are others such as
      <em>Latex</em> and <em>Markdown</em> And I don't know why a browser doesn't render those too. Here's some Latex:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: Courier New; font-size: 12px">
        \documentclass{resume} % Use the custom resume.cls style<br/>
        \begin{document}
    </p>
    <p>
    And some Markdown:
</p>
<p style="font-family: Courier New; font-size: 12px">
    # Linux Foundation Certified SysAdmin<br/>

    * Log into graphical and text mode consoles<br/>
    * Search for files<br/>
</p>

    Presumably Latex was created with the specific goal in mind to display mathematical equations and to handle references?</br>
    Why wouldn't I re-create my CV in html and css?
